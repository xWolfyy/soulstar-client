echo "Building the APK..."
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease && cd ..

# Locate the APK
APK_PATH=$(find ./android/app/build/outputs/apk/release -name "*.apk" | head -n 1)
QR_OUTPUT="soulstar_qr.png"

if [ -z "$APK_PATH" ]; then
  echo "‚ùå APK not found! Make sure the build was successful."
  exit 1
fi

# Serve the APK via HTTP
echo "Starting HTTP server..."
cd $(dirname "$APK_PATH")
python3 -m http.server &

# Generate QR Code
IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
APK_LINK="http://$IP:8000/$(basename "$APK_PATH")"
python3 -c "
import qrcode
qr = qrcode.make('$APK_LINK')
qr.save('$QR_OUTPUT')
"

echo "‚úÖ Build complete! Scan the QR code to download the APK: $QR_OUTPUT"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x build_and_qr.sh
```
